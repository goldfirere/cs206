Names (9:55-10:00)

Compiling Java (10:00-10:15)
 - Eclipse features
   - editor window
   - project explorer
      - projects / files
   - outline
   - Console
   - Javadoc
   - refactoring tools
   - running
   - collapsing

 - .java vs .class files
 - virtual machines
 - jar files

Types (10:15-10:30)
 - everything has a type
 - type serves two roles:
    - describes the shape of the data
    - describes the set of operations that are allowed to be performed
 - in Java, a type serves another role:
    - types disambiguate operations
 - Example: + on int vs + on double.
 - Conversions and casts (incl. example)

Collaboration (10:30-10:45)

Code-reading (10:45-11:00)

Classes (11:00-11:15)
 - A class groups data and operations
 - It creates **a new type**
 - Methods operate on classes
 - A `static` thing simply operates without an object.
