NO! STOP! DO NOT PROCEED!

CS206 is the wrong place to do an in-depth dive into object orientation. We won't
use it much in the rest of the semester, and it's hard. A much better place for
this is CS245. Instead of doing the whole inheritance thing, better just to do
interfaces, as these are used in the Collections framework. That is much simpler
(no superconstructors, etc.) and relevant for the course.

Inheritance (10:30-11:15)
