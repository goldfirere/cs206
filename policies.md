Prerequisites
=============

This course is a second-semester course in computer science. It is expected
that all students have taken an introductory course previously, such as CS B110,
CS B113, BIO B115, or CS H105.

Workload
--------

It is my expectation that this course is difficult. The reward is that you will
graduate from it knowing how to program! I expect that you will
have to spend 6-8 hours working outside of class/lab every week. For a two-week
assignment, this means that the assignment might take 12-16 hours or more.
One of the common refrains I have heard from students completing introductory
programming courses is that they wish they had started assignments earlier.
Don't make this same mistake.

Grading
=======

<div class="grading_table">

----------------------------  --------------
Participation                   5%
Assignments                    40%
Exam 1                         15%
Exam 2                         15%
Final Exam                     25%
<span class="strut" />
Total                          100%
----------------------------  --------------

</div>

Individual assingments/exams will be graded on a percentage basis. At the
end of the semester, these grades will be translated into the 4-point scale
roughly according to the following table (without rounding):

<div class="grading_table">

----------------------------  --------------
**Percentage**                **Grade**
0-50%                         0.0
50-57%                        1.0
57-63%                        1.3
63-69%                        1.7
69-74%                        2.0
74-78%                        2.3
78-82%                        2.7
82-86%                        3.0
86-90%                        3.3
90-94%                        3.7
94-100%                       4.0
----------------------------  --------------

Assignment grading
------------------

All assignments are graded both for correctness and for style.

Correctness indicates how well the assignment meets its
specification -- that is, does it work?
In order to grade correctness, your program must compile -- that is,
it must be free of syntactic and type errors.

Style grading assesses how well you've conformed to the [Style
Guide](style.html), which dictates how you should write your code. Programming
is an act of communication both between you and a computer *and* between you and
another human. In some sense, correctness is about the former,
while style is about the latter.

Your submitted work is a reflection of your progress in this course and your
level of attention to detail as a student. You should always strive to submit
your best work, free of messy formatting, spelling errors, and careless errors.
The programs you write will often interact with the user; you should strive to
make the user's experience pleasant and your programs easy to use.

Assignments will be returned (via Gradescope) with comments. Please read these
comments, and feel free to ask any questions if you need further clarification.

Class Participation
-------------------

This component of your grade is a reflection of how you have contributed to
this class. It includes speaking up in class, attendance, and engagement. I expect
every student to contribute to the class environment, both to improve your own
experience and to improve the experience of others. For example, you can be an
active partner when working in groups, you can post on
[Piazza], you can raise your hand
in class, and you can visit my [office hours](index.html) -- but there are
other ways to contribute, as well.

A fantastic way to contribute is to find ways to improve this material. Submit
a [pull request](https://github.com/goldfirere/cs206/pulls) against the `cs206` repo!

Exams
-----

This course has two midterms (TODO and TODO), and one self-scheduled
final exam during the normal exam period.
Exams will be closed-book and closed-note, but they will include
a reference (which you will be able to see ahead of time) listing
common Java classes and methods.

If you miss an exam without emailing me first, you will get a 0 on that
exam. Changes to the exam schedule will be considered only in extreme
circumstances.

Late policy
===========

Assignments are due by the beginning of class on the due date written on the
assignment. You will submit assignments via
[Gradescope], as practiced during [Lab 1](lab01/lab.html).

Late assignments will lose 20% of their points for every day
late (or portion thereof). Each student gets 3 free *late days* for the semester.
This means that the first three days (or portion thereof) that an assignment
is late will not lead to a penalty. These late days are intended to account for
unexpected bugs, minor illnesses, planned travel, etc. I will grant further
extensions only in rare circumstances. You do not have to request to use a late day;
they are automatically granted.

Group work policy
=================

Working with a partner
----------------------

You are allowed to work with up to one partner on all assignments, with one
caveat: no more than 2 assignments may be completed with the same partner.

If you work with a partner:
 * Make sure that both partners' names are on all parts of the assignment.
 * Register as a group within [Gradescope].
 * Submit only one copy of the assignment.

Two partners working together receive one shared grade. You may *not* collaborate
on one part of an assignment and then work separately on other parts.

Collaboration policy
--------------------

(In this section, if you are working with a partner, you and your partner are
considered "you". It is expected that partners share code!)

You are encouraged to brainstorm with others for assignments, **but your submission
must be your own**:

<div id="plagiarism">
All the code you submit must be written by you alone.
</div>

This means that, while it's a great idea to discuss general algorithms or
approaches with your classmates, **never share code**, and **never submit code
you found online**. Violators of this policy will be asked to report
themselves to the [Honor Board](http://sga.blogs.brynmawr.edu/honor-board/).

If you use a website or other resource to help in your work, **you must cite**
that resource. A comment in your code with a link is sufficient; I am not
particular about citation format. It is assumed that you can use any resource
posted on this website on any assignment; all other resources must be cited.

If you have a question, post on [Piazza].

Piazza
======

There is a course question-and-answer forum at
<https://piazza.com/brynmawr/spring2018/cs206/home>. This forum is hosted by an
educational service, Piazza, and it will be the primary means of electronic
communication in this course. It is free to use. Piazza offers the ability to ask
questions anonymously (either anonymous to everyone or only to fellow students, but not
instructors) and for one student to see others' questions. You may also use the
site to send private messages/questions to the instructors of the course.

If you have a question about the material, the course, extensions, or anything else,
please use Piazza.

Piazza also has the ability to send out announcements. Any coursewide information will
go through that site, which will send everyone an email with the info.

I do tend to respond to questions during business hours only; something posted Friday
evening might not get a response until Monday. However, an advantage to posting on
Piazza is that a fellow student or a TA might answer a question before I can.

GitHub
======

The course materials are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/goldfirere/cs206).
Feel free to submit corrections/ask clarifications there, via GitHub's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
or [issues](https://github.com/goldfirere/cs206/issues) mechanisms.

Accommodations for disability
=============================

Bryn Mawr College is committed to providing equal access to students with a
documented disability. Students needing academic accommodations for a
disability must first register with Access Services. Students can call
610-526-7516 to make an appointment with the Coordinator of Access Services,
Deb Alder, or [email her](mailto:dalder@brynmawr.edu) at `dalder@brynmawr.edu`
to begin this confidential process. Once registered, students should schedule
an appointment with me as early in the semester as possible to share the
verification form and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that
accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.
More information can be obtained at the [Access Services
website](http://www.brynmawr.edu/access_services/).

Meetings
========

My office hours for Spring 2018 are Wednesdays 9:30-11:30am.
This means that, at
these hours, I am guaranteed to be in my office and expecting visitors -- and
I really do want visitors. During class, it's hard to get to know all of you,
and I'd love to know more about what brought you into my class, what else
you're interested in (in computer science and more broadly), and how your
college experience is going generally. Come with a question, come to say hi,
or come to play one of my puzzles. You can even use your curiosity about my
puzzle collection as an excuse to get in the door.

If you have a conflict with my office hours, please email so we can find another
time to meet.

Beyond my office hours, I aim to have an open-door policy. If you see my
office door (Park 204) open, please interrupt me: that's why the door is
open!

For a broader discussion than just homework questions, I'd be happy to join
you for lunch in the dining hall. Just email or ask!
