DK: swap assignment/lab for queues assignment

--- RAE NOTES

Focus more on correctness:
 - no repetitive code (or a descriptive comment)
 - smaller scopes are better
 - comments on every method, incl. preconditions and postconditions and arg descriptions
 - no magic constants
 - crisp coding: spelling is correct, indentation is clean
 - style as deduction, not part of main points
 - no no-ops


-----------------------------------
FOR NEXT TIME:

- Less on OO. Maybe no inheritance, just interfaces. No hard casts.

DIFFICULTY

11a "not part of any of these classes" confusing

memory diagrams: specific shape is confusing

disconnection between class and assignments
 - interacting with code only in homeworks

trouble following logic
 - could talk more about pseudocode in class

coding style is different
 - all in the console
 - classes are abstract

assignment 1 was easier because there weren't classes

examples aren't applicable enough to the assignments

objective of assts 2 and 3 is more abstract

many layers of difficulty in assignments

reading is hard

assignments don't teach "writing" code

less Eclipse; more work on paper

MORE WORKSHEETS!

challenge exercises
