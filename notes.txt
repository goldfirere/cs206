DK: swap assignment/lab for queues assignment

--- RAE NOTES

Focus more on correctness:
 - no repetitive code (or a descriptive comment)
 - smaller scopes are better
 - comments on every method, incl. preconditions and postconditions and arg descriptions
 - no magic constants
 - crisp coding: spelling is correct, indentation is clean
 - style as deduction, not part of main points
 - no no-ops
